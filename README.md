# Sleep-Calc

Sleep Calc is a sleep calculator that helps users know when the best time to wake up is based on the time that they expect to fall asleep. The calculator calculates the best 
time to wake up by considering sleep cycles. According to studies it is better to wake up at the end of a sleep cycle rather in the middle of one to feel more refreshed. 

## Features

- Users can set a time of when they will be going to bed 
- Users can set a additional time of how long it usually takes them to fall asleep, which then get added into the calculations of times to wake up at.
